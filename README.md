## **Introduction**

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a **key metric** for businesses, especially in the **motor industry**. It helps predict **the total revenue a customer will generate** over their lifetime. With this prediction, companies can:

- **Identify high-value customers** and focus on retaining them.  
- **Forecast revenue** and plan operations efficiently.  
- **Optimize sales channels** for better customer engagement.  

---

## **Objectives**

The main objectives of the CLV prediction model are:  

1. **Predict future spending** by customers to estimate their lifetime value.  
2. **Segment customers** based on loyalty and spending behavior.  
3. **Optimize marketing and service strategies** for higher revenue.  
4. **Compare purchase channels** to identify the most profitable ones.

## **Key Insights**

1. **High-Value Customers are Critical for Revenue**  
   - Over **80%** of the customers in the dataset are classified as **high-value**.  
   - **Focus on loyalty programs** to retain these customers.

2. **Dealerships Outperform Other Channels**  
   - **Median CLV at dealerships** is higher compared to online and direct sales.  
   - **Insight**: Investing in dealership services will drive long-term revenue.

3. **Seasonality Impacts Customer Spend**  
   - **Spending is higher in Q1 and Q4**, suggesting that **seasonal promotions** during these periods could increase revenue.

## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

### **Distribution of Key Features**

![Distribution of Key Features](file-47iPPwQ9rDg6xARNK0Bn8It1)

- **Vehicle Types**:  
  - Cars and motorcycles are the most common.  
  - **Commercial vehicles** tend to generate higher CLV due to frequent servicing.

---

### **Loyalty and Total Spend**

![Total Spend by Customer Loyalty](file-ikoX4qZULqYQQc7zxgFoA5Gx)

- **Loyal Customers** spend ~300,000 units, compared to ~250,000 units for non-loyal ones.  
  **Insight**: Programs focused on increasing loyalty will significantly impact revenue.

---

### **Quarterly Trends in Spending**

![Average Spend by Quarter](file-p3MUtLkLsvqeGfvBXvDPqxKf)

- **Highest Spend**: Q1 (~255,000 units)  
- **Lowest Spend**: Q2 (~230,000 units)  
  **Insight**: Launching targeted campaigns in **Q1 and Q4** can boost yearly revenue.

---

## **How the Model Works**

1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - We **removed duplicates** and filled **missing values**.  
   - Numerical values like **Total Spend** and **Transaction Frequency** were **standardized**.

2. **Modeling Process**:  
   - **Random Forest** was chosen due to its ability to capture **complex patterns**.  
   - We used an **80/20 split** between training and testing data to ensure robust evaluation.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:  
   - **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Measures the average prediction error.  
   - **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: Penalizes large errors, ensuring accuracy.
